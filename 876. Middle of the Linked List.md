## Initial Thoughts and Past Experiences

Discovering the middle of a list, of a linked list, is actually part of the merge sort algorithm. And a few days ago I was experimenting and actually concluded was the one that I needed to use to store as a data structure in my database abstracted somehow to minimize writings for a list of items that I wanted to, you know, the items are strings and I wanted to semantically compare them in a way that I'm able to sort the list when I compare the items against a criteria like importance. So most important items pop on top. And so I discovered that part of the function in that merge sort has is that it needs to find recursively the middle points of lists before joining them, comparing the elements on them. And as part of that I discovered the exact same algorithm that just by reading the first part of the statement I already knew had to use two pointers, which is actually a tag that I saw later on the problem, to come up with a solution. So that's what I started pursuing.

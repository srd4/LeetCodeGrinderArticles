## Initial Thoughts and Past Experiences

Discovering the middle of a linked list, is actually part of the process on the implementation of Merge Sort for on such data structure.

A few days ago I was experimenting and concluded a Doubly linked list was what I needed to store a sorter order of elements in my database to minimize writings for a list I wanted to semantically makes comparisons in in a way that I was able to easily insert new elements in the list when comparing pairs of them against a criteria such as 'importance' so most important items would pop on top.

I discovered that part of the functioning of Merge Sort is that it needs to recursively find the middle points of lists before joining them through comparing the elements by pairs. As part of that I ended up discovering the exact same algorithm that works for a solution to this.

Just by reading the first part of the statement I already knew two pointers had to be used, which is actually a tag that I saw later on the problem, to come up with a solution. So that's what I started pursuing.

How did interactions with ChatGPT assist in understanding or solving this problem?

First time I confronted this problem, I hadn't started using ChatGPT for learning yet. And the second time, the solution I came up with right away. So, ChatGPT interactions weren't necessary.
## Discoveries and Tricky parts
Did you have any insights or moments of realization while working on this problem?

I did have a moment of realization as soon as I read it, as I said before. I realized that the solution was about using two pointers. One that was slow, another one that was faster.

The second time around, even though I remembered the approach to solving it, I was having trouble setting up the while in a way that was logical enough, so it would return the right node when the list has an even number of nodes, which means the center node is not one, but there's two center ones, and the problem specifically asks for the second. So I was having trouble configuring the while under a condition that enabled me to receive that one.

## Solution
Can you break down your solution's code? What is the role of each significant section or function?

```python
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        i, j = head, head

        while(j and j.next):
            i = i.next
            j = j.next.next

  

        return i
```

The solution involves two pointers. So you declare two variables. You assign each one the head of the list, which is what you receive. I guess I have seen other algorithms start on the second node instead of the first or on the head for the fast pointer. But I guess, yeah, it probably needs or requires a change in the condition the while loop functions with. And what you do is that you check in the while if j or jNext exists. Because if there is no jNext or if it's none, which is the same, we have reached the end. And i, if you want to go slow, is going to be at that point in the middle of the list. And if there is no j, the same happens. And inside the while, what we do is we move the slow pointer one at a time to the next node. And the fast pointer, we actually move two at a time. So it's like pressing next twice. We access the next.next. And so that basically makes that you're going to have double the steps traveled with the fast pointer at any point.

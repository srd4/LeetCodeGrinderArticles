## Initial Thoughts and Past Experiences

Discovering the middle of a linked list, is actually part of the process on the implementation of Merge Sort for on such data structure.

A few days ago I was experimenting and concluded a Doubly linked list was what I needed to store a sorter order of elements in my database to minimize writings for a list I wanted to semantically makes comparisons in in a way that I was able to easily insert new elements in the list when comparing pairs of them against a criteria such as 'importance' so most important items would pop on top.

I discovered that part of the functioning of Merge Sort is that it needs to recursively find the middle points of lists before joining them through comparing the elements by pairs. As part of that I ended up discovering the exact same algorithm that works for a solution to this.

Just by reading the first part of the statement I already knew two pointers had to be used, which is actually a tag that I saw later on the problem, to come up with a solution. So that's what I started pursuing.

## Reviewing the first problem I tackled after 7 months of Python, LeetCode, and ChatGPT as an instructor.

I wrote here: [[Final/1636. Sort Array by Increasing Frequency]] the other day about how I wanted to describe in a series of articles my exploration of data structures and algorithms. Primarily through hands-on LeetCode challenges.

I'm guided by a Python script I made in Django, after fetching all LeetCode questions locally, which follows a set of heuristics for optimized problem selection, and used ChatGPT as an instructor. With this, I dove deep into the intricacies of each problem - not just solutions but the underlying theory and thought process.

The idea is to give other self-thought programmers a firsthand look into the real-time challenges, wins, and revelations of another self-taught programmer on a path to, hopefully, mastery.

### The Problem

This first time, we’ll be diving into reflections and solutions for the first problem I seem to have ever tackled according to my database. Take a look at [the previous story](https://medium.com/@dangilbar/mastering-data-structures-and-algorithms-with-leetcode-chatgpt-and-python-a3e1780fa2d8) if you want to get more context. Else, read along!

This problem appears at the bottom when I sort my script’s database by **selected_at**. I solved it way earlier this year, around March.

Now, in October, some of the details of my initial interaction were a bit foggy.

Interesting to note the script’s benevolence in giving me an “Easy” labeled question to start with.

It has **Array**, **Hash Table**, **Bit Manipulation**, and **Sorting** as topic tags — Which I’d go on to learn solutions to problems don’t require something that involves all of them. It goes like this:

#### 645. Set Mismatch

You have a set of integers **s**, which originally contains all the numbers from **1** to **n**. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in **s** got duplicated with another number in the set, which resulted in the repetition of one number and the loss of another number.

You are given an integer array of **nums** representing the data status of this set after the error.

Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.

Example 1:  
  
Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]  
Output: [2,3]  
  
  
Example 2:  
  
Input: nums = [1,1]  
Output: [1,2]  
  
  
Constraints:  
  
2 <= nums.length <= 104  
1 <= nums[i] <= 104  
  
#### The Significance of Arrays

Arrays are so foundational in computing, that a great majority of LeetCode problems revolve around them. Around 56% in my database, actually. Hash Tables also being kind of frequent in medium to hard problems, and Sorting and Bit Manipulation still manifested to a smaller degree.

My script database’s count for questions with tag “Array” out of +2300

#### Initial Challenges with LeetCode

I remember the first few times I tried to solve the questions that my script selected, it wasn’t just the coding problem itself that presented a challenge but also my lack of experience with the platform.

At the time, quickly reading problem statements, assessing my competence for solvability, managing wasting time with my ADHD hyperfocus, determining when to move on from a tricky problem, and understanding the platform were all challenges. Thinking about this problem retroactively makes me think about how I got better at recognizing patterns in problem topics and mastering the platform’s particular way of having problem statements and test cases displayed.

Now I don’t re-read as many times as I used to, I have a better grasp of the language used on a single or second read.

I guess there’s no shame in re-reading as many times as one needs, nor these statements nor other sources like ChatGPT and Wikipedia. I do that all the time, and it seems to have and will continue to pay off.

Sorting problems are a thing because filtering information is intrinsic to how the internet and modern software function. Basic sorting algorithms and data structures like Hash Tables are supper common for that reason.

Before these problems, I think I had heard of hash tables in programming memes until I realized that in Python they’re essentially dictionaries. Or mappings, which can be visualized as the input-output sets of a function.

For instance, a fellow programmer sent me this simple exercise the other day that showcases a mapping of numbers to letters:

Little character to number mapping exercise demonstration.

#### Misdirection in Problem Statements

Revisiting the problem, I remember assuming that the list of numbers received as input was sorted, possibly due to it looking like so in the examples given.

Example 1: nums = [1,2,2,4]  
Example 2: nums = [1,1]

> Understanding problem statements without being misdirected by embedded assumptions is something one has to get good at.

LeetCode’s constraints and descriptions often provide subtle hints, but at times can also mislead.

For instance, the term “set” in the problem statement above doesn’t necessarily align with Python’s “set” data type, which inherently doesn’t hold duplicates, but these are certainly provided on the array received as input.

So the context of that word in the statement, is that they are referring to a group of numbers.

### The solution

#### Counting Sort

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nB3MS3glt_oxEDOtq48SHg.png)

The original prompt I first asked ChatGPT about counting sort with.

When I approached the problem, I instinctively **thought of counting** since the issue revolved around a duplicated number. **If one number appears twice in this 1 to n sequence, another has to appear none, because the duplicated has taken its place.**

This reminded me of the “Counting Sort” concept I had learned about. **By maintaining a count of each number’s occurrences**, it’s straightforward to identify which number appears twice and which doesn’t appear at all.

As I said the constraints posed by the problem were somewhat forgiving, but the example inputs can misguide you into wrongly assuming sorted input. The discussion section of the problem was filled with complaints about this, highlighting the importance of scrutinizing problem statements.

I’m one of the ones who believe these unclear constraints actually reflect real programming scenarios where the end-user or the client doesn’t have their application’s requirements super clear.

This later particular opinion is something I also remember acquiring from a comment section on a leetcode problem a long time ago too.

#### ChatGPT As a Study Companion

I hadn’t developed several things about the approach and method I’d end up using to get acquainted at a high level with the total of topics there is to learn at the time I tried this problem for the first time. So I hadn’t used ChatGPT to help me at all yet with this problem back in March.

ChatGPT, because of the nature of its design, is well-acquainted with LeetCode problems, probably because it was trained on the most popular of them. In fact, You can actually ask it specifically for problems and it gives you an identical statement on some.

But expecting it to generate optimal solutions on its own is really difficult, particularly the more you deviate from whatever is the set of usual solutions to usual problems out there. Attempting to use it to code solutions to complex problems actually helped me understand how the technology worked and even calm down the feeling of it being over and AI taking my job that people were freaking out about at the start of the year when it went popular.

> _If you get into the top < 10% of the most difficult, most new, or most optimized problems, ChatGPT doesn’t stand a chance against human counterparts on anything. Not even on its GPT-4 with the latests features._

It’s more productive to feed it existing contextualized solutions (human code solution + human explanation) instead of just code solution. And ask for further specific explanations on specificities at the pace of your own understanding.

Still not entirely without pitfalls. For instance, when math is involved, ChatGPT’s attempts at using LaTeX sucks.

Over time, I’ve learned to navigate its strengths and weaknesses, leveraging it best for theoretical explanations rather than expecting perfect problem solutions. And using the LeetCode platform in combination with other sources to like, test the assumptions it generates and makes me generate.

Most of the time it is hella good at translating code solutions from one language to another though. At least in the most blatantly literal “copy my homework but change it a little” type of way, so not getting the most out of the target language.

Have done it a bunch from Java to Python because there are a lot of coders of both languages who submit on LeetCode.

### Re-solving and Performance Insights

LeetCode seems to not have saved my initial solution to this problem, so I solved it again and surprisingly ended up ranking highly with 90% speed and 97% in memory. The solution feels kind of Python-istic, using counting sort.

I really liked [learning about counting sort the first time](https://chat.openai.com/share/3a8c66bb-89d9-43c9-a321-be251401ccc4), in the middle of a solution to a bigger problem that I used ChatGPT heavily to understand. This was around a month ago.

#### The Importance of Breadth in Learning

One pattern that through a breadth of leetcode questions arises is the choice of data structures and algorithms often relating to the data’s underlying structure, more than just the explicit data held/saved in it.

Take, for example, an array of strings: **[‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’]**. The explicit data is the letters, but the order, represented by the indexes **(0, 1, 2)**, is implicit information we can access and manipulate. Counting sort capitalizes on this.

My solution used an initial array with a slot for each of the numbers on input, initialized with a cero in it **[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]**— Also a pattern you see often, like preparing a surface to place things on it.

For the numbers in the input array, I used their value to index into this array and incremented the value at that position. The idea is simple: each number in the list increased the count at its respective index.

class Solution:  
    def findErrorNums(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:  
        count = [0] * len(nums)  
  
        for i in nums:  
            count[i - 1] += 1  
          
        return [count.index(2) + 1, count.index(0) + 1]

Since the input numbers range from **1** to **n** and array indexing starts at **0**, I subtracted one when accessing the array to upgrade the counts of numbers.

> By the end, the array mostly has ones, except for a 2 (indicating the repeated number) and a 0 (indicating the missing number that the repeated replaced).

To find these numbers, I just looked up the index of 2 and 0 in the array, adjusting by one to get the actual numbers.

Once identified the need to count the appearances of integers in an array, Counting Sort came to my mind, but only because I had learned about Counting Sort prior.

I find that at times you can actually come up with a good solution if you think long and hard enough, but it’s far better, and given the breadth and depth of which there is to learn, optimal, to find a way to review the knowledge first and then go and confront that in practice.

The script I made in Python for selecting questions takes that deeply into account. Including the way I approach it.

I get to pick a question from tags I’ve understood the least if I want to review theory and solutions with ChatGPT, Wikipedia, and LeetCode’s solutions section and a question from tags I’ve understood the most to go ahead and try solving it in isolation from any resources.

#### Unpacking Time and Space Complexity

I don’t remember where was it that I first saw a great explanation of what the complexities and the Big O notation thing really were.

In terms of time complexity, one has to think about how to solve an addition or subtraction exercise with pen and paper with the usual elementary school algorithm there’s like a bunch of smaller addition or subtraction operations you have to do in your head before reaching the final solution.

The bigger the initial number we want to sum up, the more operations we have to do.

More thinking translates to more complexity time-wise. Big notation is just a way of measuring the time a computer would spend thinking our particular instructions, that not going to lie, still at times feels arbitrary (because it kind of is unless you really get down to it).

And so the overall point of data structures and algorithms is like first being able to solve the problem, then being able to make better and better instructions that use less and less time and space.

> And ultimately develop the knowledge and skill to recognize and jump to those most efficient solutions.

Space complexity is understood as the literal information that has to be stored somewhere in your computer, in memory. And thinking about reducing it.

The overall time complexity of my solution is roughly **O(N)**, as I only loop through the nums array. **Each iteration of the loop, together with what happens inside it, we can consider being one operation.**

For instance, for 5 numbers, there are 5 operations, the complexity is 5. For 9 numbers, 9 operations, 9 of complexity.

To generalize this then, like in high school algebra, we use letters: For N numbers, the complexity grows as N grows (N numbers, N comparisons).

And the notation agreed on in our field to express that generality for any value N received as input, is used like this: O( F(N) )

F(N) is just a way of representing the fact that a function, or algebraic expression, has N in it — or is expressed in terms of N. So for example F(N) can be N itself, can be 2N, can be N² or 2^n, etc. In our case, for N numbers we do N operations, so O(N) is how you’d see this complexity represented.

The space complexity is also O(N) due to the array I created having space for the count of each one of the N numbers.

While optimizing complexities is essential, I also value my own time and the need to understand the breadth of problems. After deriving a satisfactory solution (in practice, which at the beginning I barely ever did) or understanding in-depth ChatGPT and other sources, I might peek at others' solutions to gain different perspectives on LeetCode’s Solution section. But obsessing over runtime and memory rankings isn’t my thing. It’s important to grasp big O notation, but balance is key.

#### Reflecting on Progress and Key Learnings

Writing this article, for instance, I notice how revisiting problems after gaining more experience can be enlightening. I remember I struggled with this problem initially, and in particular with that lack of reading comprehension that a lot of people in the discussion section blame on the people that wrote the problem.

Upon returning, my broader knowledge enabled me to find an efficient solution and not be misled by the statement, examples, or constraints. This balance between diving deep and moving forward I’ve found essential.

I would say that from the experience of solving this problem and others at that early stage, I learned the importance of reading problem statements carefully and discerning factual assumptions from potentially incorrect ones.

I also started recognizing the significance of array manipulation in data structures and algorithms.

### Closing Thoughts

Array indexing and the hidden information within all data structures (like the indexes of an array) are worth paying attention to. Confronting this problem this time felt rewarding, particularly since it marked my first application of the counting sort algorithm which I recall discussing with ChatGPT and consulting its Wikipedia page in the path to understanding a harder problem.

If you have any problem going through these, when you hit a roadblock, seek hints progressively until after spending a little bit stuck trying to figure things out. Dive into discussions when needed. But always challenge yourself first before seeking external insights.

Thank you for reading. I hope you enjoyed!

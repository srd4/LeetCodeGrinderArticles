## Initial thoughts 

Initially me and  others on the discussion and solutions sections, considered a greedy approach to optimize the placement of carpets to cover the most white tiles at each step. However, it became clear that the greedy approach didn't yield the optimal solution. It was rather necessary to find the optimal solution at each step and sum those together to get the total optimal, or minimal in this case.

My first thought the first time I encountered this problem was likely about manipulating arrays somehow. Trying the greedy approach this second time and finding a couple counter examples, I discarded it. It was kind of interesting to see this kind of problem the first time around. The difficulty a bit intimidating. And this was probably the first time I saw the use of diagrams to explain the problem statement.

## Past experiences

I've come across similar problems or topics related to dynamic programming before, but this is likely the first of its kind I tackled. The concept often feels confusing, especially around the pre-computation of values to be reused later. Understanding solutions is one thing, but devising my own can and still do feel hellish. I've seen similar problems with the tag strings and prefix sum, which is just another term for cumulative sum, made me recall the concept.

The dynamic programming approach required here keeps a sum of the remaining visible white tiles in a two-dimensional array, which is a bit reminiscent of problems with prefix sum I've encountered before.

## ChatGPT interaction

With ChatGPT I usually follow a couple prompting patterns for seeking tag explanations and understanding tricky solutions on LeetCode, often times from specific recurrent users like Lee215 whose English may be hard to understand but solutions are spot on. I find ChatGPT useful in elaborating on those solutions, explaining the logic and code involved in a structured manner, to enhance understanding.

I prefer to ask ChatGPT to clarify existing human made solutions rather than asking it to provide new ones himself, as it can sometimes hallucinate or offer less optimal solutions.

For the problem, initially, I thought a greedy approach might work but soon realized it led to suboptimal solutions. Through interactions and reviewing different solutions, I explored solutions with different approaches to dynamic programming, learning more about bottom-up and top-down strategies, and when to use dynamic programming. However, I didn't get to ask all my questions due to time constraints.

I also wondered if the problem could be approached as a sliding window scenario, considering each carpet's starting index rather than a greedy placement. Initially, I pursued a wrong route based on this insight. This evolved through discovering a crucial example in the discussion section and self-discovery in isolation, leading me to understand that the problem had a larger search space with more possibilities for carpet placements. I tweaked around a more in-depth second solution compared to Lee215's succinct, Pythonic solution.

## Tricky parts

It was tricky figuring out how to traverse the space of carpet placement combinations. Dynamic programming (DP) is always a bit daunting and it doesn't intuitively come to mind as a solution. Although there weren't any coding constraints, understanding the DP approach and the problem's optimal substructure was challenging still. The goal is to minimize something by finding minima in sub-sequences, which was hard to visualize.

With more learning and a closer look, I might get better at it, but I still don't feel strong on this one and haven't marked it as understood on my database yet.

## Solution


```python
class Solution:
    def minimumWhiteTiles(self, A, k, l):

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, k):
            if i <= 0: return 0
            return min(int(A[i - 1]) + dp(i - 1, k), dp(i - l, k - 1) if k else 1000)
            
        return dp(len(A), k) 

```

As mentioned, the solution revolves around a DP approach to minimize the number of visible white tiles after placing a given number of carpets on a floor represented by the string `floor`. The core of this solution is the `dp` function, which is memoized using `lru_cache` to improve performance by storing the results of previous computations.

The `dp` function takes two arguments: `i`, the current index in the string representing the `floor`, and `k`, the number of carpets left to lay. The function is called recursively, working from right to left across the string, considering two main choices at each step: placing a carpet or not.

1.  **Not Placing a Carpet:** If a carpet isn't placed at the current index, the function adds `1` to the count if a white tile is present (`int(A[i - 1])` converts the character at the current index to an integer, adding `1` if it's a white tile), and then `dp` calls itself recursively with `i - 1`, moving one step to the left, keeping the count of remaining carpets `k` unchanged.

2. **Placing a Carpet:** If a carpet is placed, the function calls itself recursively with `i - l`, jumping back by the length of a carpet, and `k - 1`, reducing the count of remaining carpets by `1`. However, this choice is only considered if there are carpets left to place (`k` is not zero), otherwise, a large value (`1000`) is used to represent an undesirable choice, effectively ignoring this option.  

The recursion continues until the left end of the string is reached (`i <= 0`), at which point `0` is returned, serving as the base case to terminate the recursion.

The `minimumWhiteTiles` method initiates the dynamic programming process by calling `dp` with the initial index set to the length of the string `A`, and the initial count of carpets `k`, and returns the result, representing the minimum number of visible white tiles after placing all carpets optimally.


[1:53 PM, 10/24/2023] Daniel Gil: Can you break down your solution's code? What is the role of each significant section or function? For this, it's kind of complicated, well, not so much. On the high level, you can think of it as we're basically considering all the possibilities at each step when the choice that we can make at each step is either placing a carpet at such index, or starting at that index, or not placing it, right? And so as we are optimizing to find the, you know, given the problem statement, the minimum number of white tiles still visible at the end, at each step, we do the same. That's why the substructure of the problem is optimal, I think, because, you know, if I find the minimum in shorter segments of the original string, and if I sum up those steps, at the end I'm going to have the minimum across the whole string, right? And so to find the minimum, there is among two choices. We basically pick what is best, what is most efficient. Not placing the carpet or placing it? Not placing the carpet implies that we have to take into account the sum of one if there is a white tile that is going to end up being visible, so we have to count it if we don't place the carpet, right? And then we have to sum that with whatever carpets are in the rest of the decisions. And so we call, again, dp, but on the next index. And we're going from index length of floor, or index n, or basically we go from the right, far right of the string toward the left, at least in the order, not in the order, but in the, yeah, in the manner in which the function calls that we make in this solution are going to be placed on the stack. The other second option is to actually place a carpet which would occupy whatever the length of the carpet is in indexes. So the next dp we're going to call in that case is going to be current index minus, not one to the next, but i, the current index, minus the length of the carpets that the problem gives us. And so we effectively move until the other extreme of the carpet, continuing all places we can actually place carpets onto, and we effectively also reduce k, which is the value of carpets left to place, by one, because we just placed one. If k is zero, so we have already placed all the carpets, we return a thousand on the right side of the min, which given that it is the maximum number of carpets that there could be, ultimately what it means is that when we don't have any more carpets, we have to count the visible white, if there is at this index. So we go to the right side, and we move to the next index, one place next to it. And so the dp starts with receiving an index, the index is for the place that we're going to be thinking about, and a number of carpets.


Optimization - Did you identify potential areas for optimization in your solution?


[2:06 PM, 10/24/2023] Daniel Gil: Optimization. Did you identify potential areas for optimization in the solution? Well, it was hard to understand what the complexity of each one of the solutions was to begin with. I guess if you end up doing the tabulation thing with dynamic programming, it seems that you end up registering k states of the count for each one of the indexes or tiles. So basically you have, and k corresponds to the carpets, the number of carpets. So you basically have what happened at this index after placing x carpets. And x goes through 0 all the way to k, the number of carpets. And the indexes go from 0 to n, n being the length of the initial input string. So we basically have n times c states. Or so problems can be called. This is probably the hardest question that I've confronted in this article manner, so I have still a lot of questions about it. But I was chatting with GPT, and for me it was kind of stupid that you can even have or even care about collecting a state such as an index 0 having placed, let's say, 1,000 carpets. Because if you're at 0 and you place 1,000 carpets, I mean, if you're in the same spot, placing the second carpet makes no sense, right? And the third and the fourth and the 1,000 on top of each other is like, why would I care about computing that kind of thing? And in fact, why would I care about placing one carpet exactly on top of the previous one at all? Does that even happen in the code? I still have so many questions, dude.

[2:29 PM, 10/24/2023] Daniel Gil: Did you identify potential areas for optimization in your solution? I mean, just understanding the complexity of the thing that I guess is given for the amount of calculations that are done, which could be optimized for some kind of stupid states that the actual code considers, because it's basically for the N tiles, considering what would happen at each tile having placed 0, 1, 2, 3, all the way to K, K being the number of carpets, which basically gives N times C. But there are some stupid cases like why would you consider placing K carpets one on top of each other on the first case, on the first tile? I mean, it's just repeating the same thing. So I guess that's where they open space for further optimizing and making space be less than that. And I don't know if time complexity also. But in general, or in any case, it is still kind of confusing. I think this is the first problem that makes me question the nature of these articles that I'm trying to write, because I can't do for the time being unless I decide to waste more time. And my experience has been that the quicker I move away from problems that I'm frustrated or stuck in, the better and stronger I come later at confronting them, when confronting them again. So I'll move forward and confirm with this that the nature of these articles is documenting my process. This is super difficult to understand.

Learned - How does this problem fit into broader concepts within data structures, algorithms, or computer science?

[2:32 PM, 10/24/2023] Daniel Gil: How does this problem fit into broader concepts within data structures, algorithms, or computer science? I guess the dynamic programming is super fundamental, the stuff related to it. I guess this time I got into understanding a little bit of this, maybe to an intermediate level of depth, on the recursiveness and the nature of that tabulation or memoization kind of thing, and also the way you can implement that same thing with iteration, which conceptually is just making tables, tabulation, right, for keeping the state of things. I also understood a little bit more in handy the thing about optimally solving problems and how a bigger problem that is constructed with optimal solutions to smaller problems, one, can be solved with dynamic programming, and two, that kind of structure is the optimal for dynamic programming, right? We discovered that a greedy kind of approach or algorithm can not hold in smaller solutions of things, for which proceeds that a dynamic programming solution for, I mean, from which it follows that greed is not the approach and is rather a perfect kind of problem to solve with dynamic programming. I think that's kind of what I understood. 


Further - Are there any resources, readings, or tools that you found particularly helpful or

Further, are there any resources, readings, or tools that you found particularly helpful or enlightening to this problem? I guess two solutions that I evaluated. I checked the hints and lit code a little bit, and the conversation that I had with Chad Dubity that I was due to expand on, but I'm not tempted to use more of my time stuck understanding at a low level this question. I can give it a little bit of a break before delving more into these topics, but it's clear that dynamic programming is one of those topics that I have to pay more attention to because it is still challenging.

## Initial thoughts.
What methods or algorithms came to mind when you first approached this problem?

I remember at the beginning of starting to confront LeetCode problems I made these judgments based on my ability that something was more difficult than it seemed. And problems with diagrams like this, I'd go "Jesus Christ" a lot of times. But once you get pass that and actually judge a problem by what it really is, you are going to discover a lot of verbose problems being actually quite simple, and a lot others being the totally opposite lol.

The context in which the problem is discussed is basically graphs. They talk about edges and vertices.

I noticed early on that you are able to visualize this like a binary string, where each position in the string can take either a 1 or a 0. The monkeys can each one make one movement. They can go left, or right or we can think of it as they can go 1 or they can go 0. There has to be one decision for each monkey. So the absolute possible total of combinations of monkey movements in a n-vertex polygon will be the total combinations that you get with n positions in the binary string.

Because there are n positions and each one of the positions can take two values, either a 1 or a 0 you basically have 2<sup>n</sup> combinations.

Now the problem becomes (which was actually the only hint this problem had) counting the combinations that don't produce collisions in order to subtract it from that value of total possible combinations of movements which I know to be 2<sup>n</sup>.

## Past experiences.
Are there related problems or topics you've encountered that share similarities with this one?

Vertices and edges are basic nomenclature that you deal with on problems that make use of graphs of any kind. But I could also, interestingly enough, relate this to even elementary level mathematics or geometry, where they talk about vertices and edges. Everything goes full circle one way or another.

There are a lot of problems that make you think about edges and vertices. I remember a lot of times being confused of what they meant by vertices and edges and kind of like mistaking one for the other. But now it's quite faster to understand what people are talking about in my head while I read. I guess the reading comprehension in regards to that kind of context and vocabulary has improved in me. 

And yeah, there's a lot of problems about that. So if at the beginning you feel kind of slow with them or their nomenclature, keep grinding, is not that they get easier, but you actually get harder.

There are also a lot of problems about basically having to surround or enumerate possibilities. Actually, there's a literal enumeration tag where you have to discover and list each one of the edge cases that you discover for the problem and decide how to handle them explicitly.

In this case it is kind of like that because you have to discover that each monkey can move one direction or the other in one step. They can't go any further. So those options of movements are the cases that we enumerate, account for and handle in our code. Then we have to think about the possible combinations of that.

If there's not only one monkey, but it's two monkeys or three monkeys or four. And the number of monkeys depends on the number of vertices in the polygon, and such number having each the ability to make one decision or another make a set of combinations of final decisions accounting for what each monkey chose.

So, in summary, confronting LeetCode I've found, problems about both graphs, and things that have to do with enumeration and like literally and explicitly with binary stuff, binary strings and bit manipulation, that's another common one. The first even if it's just geometric problems that are easy like this or complex problems that you still have to abstractly think about graphs and edges while working with arrays. And the second for an actual wide range of use cases.

## ChatGPT interaction
How did interactions with ChatGPT assist in understanding or solving this problem?

I didn't use ChatGPT this time around. Neither this time, nor the time I approached the problem for the first time back in April.

I actually started using it more heavily after this when I purchased the GPT-Plus and decided to use it as an instructor.

But this second time I've approached this problem I can definitely see how my discussions with it regarding Bit Manipulation, Enumeration, and Graphs, particularly the vocabulary around graphs, has remarkably eased the difficulty of reading problem statements. And narrowing down the possible solutions.

I actually find myself making less inappropriate assumptions. And this not only happens with problems I've seen, I still find with new problems that I confront, that I have a narrower and more targeted, focused set of possibilities of assumptions to make about things, and that I'm each time more likely to get them right.

So I find that my assumptions, first of all, are each and each time more accurate. And I think it's to a great degree due to how ChatGPT and I have interacted in the context of solving other problems ranging in topics and difficulty on LeetCode with this approach of mine.

## Discoveries.
Did you have any insights or moments of realization while working on this problem?

Reviewing this problem, having confronted it already before, It's difficult to tell if I came up with a solution by myself just now.

I mean, probably every short-term memory queue that was left from the first time that I saw it is erased enough, but maybe far back into the longer-term memory part of my brain there may still be some pattern established only from that time that I suffered in frustration trying to come up with a solution to the problem. 

I think about this, because this time I actually found the solution to be super straightforward.

What I mean is, I do know I have now further insights on how to verify that the assumption I made about the correct solution is correct, but it is difficult to know if making that right assumption was directly influenced by having encountered and remembering somehow the patterns in the solution the first time around.

In any case, there was a big moment of realization when I understood, first of all, what I explained earlier about understanding this as Bit Strings: the combinations of decisions that are possible for all the monkeys to make.

The second one was discovering that as the great majority of the combinations would produce collisions, I had to worry about counting the ones where no collisions happened.

And so I did, and I discovered the only way that not having collisions neither on vertices nor edges happen is by having all the monkeys moving in the same direction, which can be either clockwise or the other way around, anti-clockwise.

Which means subtracting 2 from the total possible combination of decisions that they can make.

## Solution
Can you break down your solution's code? What is the role of each significant section or function?

```Python
class Solution:
    def monkeyMove(self, n: int) -> int:
        mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
        return (pow(2, n, mod) - 2) % mod
```

## Tricky parts
Were there specific elements or constraints in the problem that seemed tricky or noteworthy?

Remember how I just talked about how sometimes rather verbose problems would be super easy and the other way around? well, that's basically what I just got into trying to understand in depth what we need to be doing with the modular operation.

And we don't need to go so far back. The only thing that we need to know is that if we have a set of numbers that we want to evaluate and the result after the evaluation is going to be super big, one way we can set a boundary for what those values can be is using the modulus operation.

Basically if you apply modulus to any value, you force the result to be inside a range from zero to the value you are applying the mod with `[0, mod]`, which makes all the results of doing modulo on some number positive and up until modulo, including it. And if you evaluate over modulo a number that's bigger than that, it's going to give you a result that is in that range.

So the modulo operation is a lot of times, including this one, used to make values fit into a range.

And in the case of our problem, it effectively gives us a bound for values that could be huge because we can't directly calculate 2<sup>n</sup> and then just subtract 2 from it because n could be super huge, and the result even bigger.

If I remember correctly, all of those modular arithmetic considerations for optimization are intrinsic to the way the pow function in Python works.

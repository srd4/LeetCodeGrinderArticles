Initial thoughts.
What methods or algorithms came to mind when you first approached this problem?

The context in which the problem is discussed is basically graphs. They talk about edges and vertices.

I noticed early on that you are able to visualize this like a binary string, where each position in the string can take either a 1 or a 0. The monkeys can each one make one movement. They can go left, or right or we can think of it as they can go 1 or they can go 0. There has to be one decision for each monkey. So the absolute possible total of combinations of monkey movements at once will be the total combinations that you get with n positions in the binary string.

Because there are n positions and each one of the positions can take two values, either a 1 or a 0 you basically have 2<sup>n</sup> combinations. Now the problem becomes, and that was actually the hint counting the combinations that don't produce collisions in order to  subtract it from that value which of total possible combinations of movements I know to be.

, which I remember at the beginning, you make these judgments based on your ability that something is more difficult than it seems. And problems with diagrams like this, you go like, oh my god, what is it? But in this case, it was super simple.
